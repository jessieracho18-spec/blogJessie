    <h1>ME, MY SELF AND I</h1>
    <p>Hi mga Migo! Welcome to my blog 👋😎</p>
  </header>

  <main>
  
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Jessie V. Racho Jr.</strong>, a second-year <strong>BSIT</strong> student who’s learning, growing,
        and discovering more about life every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and lessons as I figure out who I am
        and who I want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I’m passionate about pushing myself to new limits — whether it’s through athletics,
        teamwork, or real-world challenges like my <strong>EMS training</strong>. These experiences have helped me
        build resilience, confidence, and a strong sense of purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <strong>BSIT student</strong>, I’m fascinated by how technology shapes our world. I enjoy exploring how
        digital tools and innovation can make a difference in everyday life, especially when combined with compassion,
        leadership, and service.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe growth never stops — every success, failure, and challenge is a step toward becoming a better version
        of myself. My journey is still unfolding, and I’m excited to keep learning, connecting, and inspiring others
        along the way.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Blog Is About</h2>
      <p>
        Life isn’t always easy, but I’ve learned that happiness starts within —
        not from what others think of us, but from how we see ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, you’ll find stories about my daily life, small victories, challenges,
        and reflections on self-love and confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to inspire others to be proud of themselves, even when things aren’t perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is a personal space where I document my growth — as a student, a teammate, and
        an individual striving to make a difference. It’s about celebrating progress, not perfection,
        and finding strength in every experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want to share the lessons I’ve gained through my <strong>EMS training</strong> and my journey in
        <strong>Information Technology</strong>. Both fields taught me discipline, teamwork, and compassion —
        qualities that go beyond academics or skills. They remind me that helping others and staying curious
        are at the heart of true success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re here to read, reflect, or just find motivation, I hope this space reminds you that
        your story matters. Keep learning, keep growing, and never forget how far you’ve come.

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting — let's grow and learn together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every journey begins with a single step, and each challenge we face helps shape the person we become.
        Whether it’s on the track, in the field, or during EMS training, growth comes from pushing ourselves
        beyond what we thought was possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through dedication, discipline, and passion, we can turn every experience into a lesson and every lesson
        into strength. The moments of struggle are just as valuable as the moments of success — they remind us
        why we started in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m deeply grateful for everyone who has been part of this journey — mentors, teammates, classmates,
        and friends. Your support, encouragement, and guidance continue to inspire me to do better and be better
        each day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is more than just a gallery of photos and certificates — it’s a reflection of growth,
        perseverance, and purpose. I hope it inspires you to pursue your goals wholeheartedly and to never stop
        learning, no matter where life takes you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Representing Region XI – Southern Mindanao and my beloved school at the
        <time datetime="2023">2023 National PRISAA Meet</time> in Zamboanga City
        was one of the most unforgettable moments of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I reached that stage, I trained for many days under the hot sun.
        There were times when I felt tired, doubtful, and wanted to give up. But
        with hard work, discipline, and faith, I continued to push myself. Every
        drop of sweat and every early morning run was worth it when I finally
        stepped on the national field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined the 100m dash, 4x100m relay, and long jump, giving my best with
        pride and determination. Even though I didn’t win a medal, I gained
        something more important — experience, growth, and a deeper love for the sport.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting to Know Yourself</h2>
      <p>
        Getting to know yourself is one of the best journeys in life. Every feeling,
        every challenge, and every happy moment helps us become stronger. I hope
        that by sharing my story, I can inspire others to discover themselves too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding who you are takes time — it’s about accepting your flaws,
        celebrating your strengths, and being honest with yourself. It’s learning
        to listen to your thoughts, trust your instincts, and embrace both your
        victories and your mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, this requires venturing beyond your comfort zone to discover your true potential.
        Whether it’s through studying, training, helping others, or simply reflecting on your day,
        each experience reveals a new part of who you are meant to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, you’ll realize that growth isn’t always about big achievements —
        it’s often found in quiet moments of reflection, forgiveness, and courage
        to keep going even when things get tough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting to know yourself also means finding your purpose.
        For me, that purpose comes from learning, serving others, and becoming
        a better version of myself every day — both in my <strong>IT studies</strong>
        and my <strong>EMS journey</strong>. These experiences remind me that true
        fulfillment comes from growth, connection, and compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting <em>Me, Myself, and I</em>. Let us grow and learn together.
